# Example Tasks for a "Hello, World!" Project

This file outlines a set of tasks for building a simple Next.js project. In this project, the user enters their name in a text box on the Home Page and is then greeted with "Hello, {name}" on a separate Greeting Page.

Here's an example prompt to use to generate this. Note that you'll first want to either provide a detailed set of notes / prd of exactly what to build, or have a two-step process where you have the AI create the spec, then proceed with this step:
Be sure to use an advanced thinking model with this, ideally "Deep Research" from OpenAI but o1-pro, o3-mini, flash-2-thinking, or (maybe?) DeepSeek R1 could work as well. 

``` txt
Great! Now convert that information into a very very detailed markdown numbered list of 1 story point tasks that an AI coding agent can complete.
Be sure to pull in the necessary data for each storybook story and be detailed about the exact data and storybook story states should be for each component.
This will likely be a long detailed list in markdown, be sure to use numbers for the top-level story title and checkboxes (all default unchecked) for each
substep of the story with the details.
```

After you generate this task list, here is a prompt to use in cursor agent to kick this off (might be useful to put at the end of your cursorrules file as well?)
Probably helpful to just @include the cursor-tasks.md file as well. 
``` txt
Go through each task in the .cursor-tasks file. After you complete each task, update the file to check off any task. Run builds and commits after each task. Continue with each task until you have checked off each one. After each story, do not take a screenshot. If you need more detail about a task, you can gather relevant files and pass the FULL file to the research agent.
```
